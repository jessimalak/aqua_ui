A Flutter package that revives the iconic Aqua style of Mac OS X, allowing you to create interfaces with the classic, glossy, and translucent aesthetic of the original macOS — directly in your cross-platform applications. inspired on [flutter95](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter95) and [xp_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/xp_ui)
